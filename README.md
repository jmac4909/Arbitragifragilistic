Scraping sites and making bytes

(not anymore) You need scrappy 1.6.6? something like that theres a 6 somehwere

(nevermind this) To run spidder (with scrappy) you nav to .py file and enter:  'scrapy runspider main.py'
Will create a new json file in the same dir

Needs Selenium 3.141 (https://pypi.org/project/selenium/)
right now just throws all the values at you, you can see where they are on the site tho. Just need to parse the data

TODO: Extract all the individual races from https://www.betfair.com/exchange/plus/horse-racing
TODO: Parse those races
HOWTO: We find all the links in table and then just collect those bad boys (probs) (didnt think to hard about it)
